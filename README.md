# Micro_IT_FileEncryption-DecryptionTool_Project
A File Encryption and Decryption Tool is a software application that secures data by converting files into an unreadable format (encryption) and restoring them to their original form (decryption) using a key or password. This project demonstrates basic cryptography and file handling techniques.
